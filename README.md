Ecommerce Platform
Our project is E-commerce .This e-commerce project is designed to offer a straightforward shopping experience:
1.Item Selection: Users can explore various items available for purchase on the platform.

2.Add to Cart Functionality: They can easily add desired items to a virtual cart for later review and purchase.

3.Cart Details: The cart displays the number of items added and calculates the total quantity of selected items.

4.Total Cost: Additionally, the project shows the total cost of all items added to the cart, making it convenient for users to track their expenses.

E-commerce simplifies buying and selling by enabling transactions online, offering convenience, accessibility, and a global marketplace for goods and services.

## How it Works ?
1.Explaining the working of project. 

An e-commerce project is like an online store:
1.Showcasing Products: It displays things to buy, like a catalog or a shop window.

2.Adding to Cart: You click on things you want, and they go into your "virtual basket" to buy later.

3.Checkout: When you're ready, you go to the "cashier" (checkout), pay, and choose how you want things delivered.

4.Stock Control: Behind the scenes, it keeps track of what's available so you don't buy something that's sold out.

5.Safety Measures: There's a team making sure your information stays safe while you shop.

It's like having a store at your fingertips, making shopping easier and faster.
